<h3>Design Sprint (or Sprint) - a google ventures framework.</h3>
<p>Have you heard about Design Sprint before?</p>
<p>My intention with this post is not to teach about Sprint, but to share an experience that I had on my previous company. We were working for like forever in a legacy system, adding features and fixing bugs, but the web application runs at IE8 only - You probably experiences the same in 2010, but... So at some point the company will have to proposed an upgrade for our customer.</p>
<p>Migrate a legacy system is not easy, estimate how many hours to have a first version - without any metrics - well, that’s even harder. But luckily, at the same week I was reading about Design Sprint and how google used to experiment their ideas before develop their products. So, perhaps, it can be useful for my case as well.</p>
<p>It’s really nice when you work for a company that buys your crazy ideas and they bought this one of mine. My plan was simple, I choose 5 co-workers from different areas and with different skills which I knew will be helpful for our goal. We spent a week inside a room, isolated from the other projects, to focus in produce an navigable UI with our viaion of how should the application looks like. </p>
<p>And after that, we were able to map what’s need to be migrated and how many time it will take (in an imaginary world).</p>
<p>We received a great feedback from the customer, from our company, but what makes me feel really proud was see that group of amazing people working together and enjoying that moment.</p>
<p>What I learned from that experience is that you should never stop learning and trying new things - keep your mind open and hungry!</p>
